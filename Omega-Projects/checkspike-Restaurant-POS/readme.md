In March 2016, Club President Denzie Gray was approached by Prof. Philip McGrath (Curriculum Chair for Culinary Arts & Management Program). Regular dining services are held as part of that Food Service Administration program involving staff, students, and volunteers.

At some point, two Windows tablets were purchased--with the intention of installing standard restaurant point-of-sale (POS) software. This software would assist in handling customer transactions, and allow service coordination between the kitchen and front-of-house.

A POS system was either never purchased, never created, or just somehow never installed on the Food Service tablets.
Prof. McGrath contacted our club to see if we'd be interested in creating a mobile Restaurant Management App.

His original pitch was for a comprehensive suite of restaurant management software, including the following features:
  - **POS System**<br />
    Allows front-of-house hosts to seat customers at tables, waiters to input customer orders, kitchen staff to see the orders generated, and automatic generation of a customer bill/receipt, along with payment processing. Menu item objects to be created, editable, customizable, and grouped by restaurant manager into various menus. Should have support for login and authentication of user credentials.
  - **Inventory System**<br />
    Menu items served and billed to the customer should automatically subtract appropriate component supplies from a restaurant inventory database. This database will be added to by restaurant staff when restaurant receives shipment of inventory supplies.
  - **Management/Budget System**<br />
    Allows restaurant managers to track long-term changes in business metrics, including inventory value, gross profit, operating expenses, etc.
  - **Staff Hour Tracking System** ("Payroll" but NOT)<br />
    Allows tally and tracking of hours worked by various staff members. Generates various printed reports for records and management decision making.
